Things to do
-USE ENUMS FOR MORE THINGS ESPECIALLY FOR THE STATUS'S
-Organize classes into folders so its easier to locate parent and child
classes
-Change the variable names to be more easier to understand
-Refactor the code to make it easy to read and easy to modify
-Comment the code
-Region the code
-Make a status class which holds the aliment 
-Add gold feature to all the classes that need it
-Make a monster part class that is derived from item class
-Then add a mosnter part object in equipment so that that is the 
requirement for crafting that itemS 
-Keep it optional
-For now I'm going to keep adding the basic framework and such however,
almost all the classes so far are very similar I should make a base class/interface that they all
inherit from for refactoring

Plans
-I want to add the basics to all the classes basically making the data tpyes of the whole project
-Then I might refactor the classes to make them better formatted
-Then I will add actual functionality to the class

Ideas
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
//I dont think this would be that hard to implement however its my decision whether id want to
or not

Quests
-What is a quest
-A quest has several attritubes
-An entity giving the quest
-The player choosing whether to accept the quest or not
-The quest has a name
-THe quest has a description
-The quest has a goal
-The quest has a reward
-The quest can be only be given once

WHat type of quests can their be and how can we create them?
-The quest can be a qeust to kill a ceritan monster 5 times
-The quest can be to kill a certain monster and get a 3 rat tails
-The quest can be to go to a certain location 
-The quest can be to give money or something like that

-How can we make the quest class flexible enough so that i can make
the requirement for any quest rather easily without it taking to long

Possibility teach quest classs as every other class system in the game
where you make the quest class the base class and you make child classes
for specific requirements. So a killquest class for quests with killing
a gatheringquest for quests for gathering a traverse class for trasversing
to a certain location. This may mean i have to create many classes
just to make more unique quests but ill have to use this for now
So far my architecture all follows a pretty similar pattern and it works
well so i might as well use it when im trying to make quests instead
of trying to treat it differently
