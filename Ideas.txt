Bosses
Power vs Items System
If you use your charges on power then you will get probably double increase in power on next 
action such as attack spell or item
Damage Item
Create a copy function for eneemies

If you use your charges on luck then you will get more items from loot and maybe ill flip
the item table so maybe I'll do this maybe ill make it if you do it 3 times or something the 
loot table flips or something like this but some kind of mechanic like this

I EXCLUDED 4 CLASSES FROM THE CLASSES MAKE SURE TO TRULY REMOVE THOSE CLASSES WHEN YOU ARE READY

Make lines between map pictures

Different exp rates for different classes

FIX THE FACT THAT I AM NOT CLONING ENEMIES AND ITEMS
-Equipment can be just one because it by just one player
-But enemies can be repeated so they should be cloned over and over

When they cast a spell flash a picture for a second so it looks like an animation

sound effects

music

Ideas
-Game Creator App where I make a simple app that allows the user to create the world for the game
and then the app converts it into xml files/this will need to be done after the game is complete
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
-If you survive with item, item goes up a tier dead by daylight

Items
-HP heals
-MP heals
-Silence curer
-Darkness curer
-Slime curer
-Stat boosting items?
