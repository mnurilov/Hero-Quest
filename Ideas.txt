How do I add mana usage
Mana I want mana to be the way the player uses spells
The player must have enough mana to use a spell 
Therefore the use spell function must first check if they have enough mana
If they dont have enough mana return false and place the apporiate message
If they do lower their mana on the Player class

NotRefactored Folder Classes
-Game Session

TIPS FOR REFACTORING
-Smaller functions don't make finds huge
-Fix all the public and private and internal
-Make sure the UI is not touching the player class it can only access it through gameSession
-Make sure Player's function are doing simple things that don't change other classes
-Let Game Session handle interactions between objects
-Fix ordering


CODE LAYOUT
-Engine will handle all calculations and logic
-GameSession will handle all the objects interacting with each other
-UI will handle display

<-----Things to Do----->
-Bosses
-I EXCLUDED 4 CLASSES FROM THE CLASSES MAKE SURE TO TRULY REMOVE THOSE CLASSES WHEN YOU ARE READY
-Make lines between map pictures
-Different exp rates for different classes

-sound effects
-music
-Add icon to hero quest main page
-Icons to all stats Health gets a heart strength gets fist etc 
-Fix how quests are linked with locations and how to location what you are looking for
