I EXCLUDED 4 CLASSES FROM THE CLASSES MAKE SURE TO TRULY REMOVE THOSE CLASSES WHEN YOU ARE READY
Attack bonus to strenght bonus in equipment class
Make lines between map pictures
Different exp rates for different classes

When creating the game you need to draw these things out
-World Map on Paper
-Item List on Paper
-Enemy List on Paper
-Equipment List on Paper
-Spell List on Paper
-Vendor List on Paper
-Quest List on Paper

Add a cap on the gold like a Constant cap


Format
Player should just do the functions hes given
Game Session should control which functions hes allowed to do at a given time
this includes changing the players game state
The UI should just reflect the Game Session's state but the UI should not control the game state's
like it kinda currently does


THINGS TO DO NEXT TIME:
-DEBUG MODE where a variable is set on and when it is you can see all the output

Ideas
-Game Creator App where I make a simple app that allows the user to create the world for the game
and then the app converts it into xml files/this will need to be done after the game is complete
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
-If you survive with item, item goes up a tier dead by daylight

Items
-HP heals
-MP heals
-Silence curer
-Darkness curer
-Slime curer
-Stat boosting items?

Weapons
Sword and Shield - Warrior
Mage and Tome - Mage
Dagger and Dagger - Thief

Quests
-Kill Quest
-Gather Quest
-Travel Quest
-Interact Quest
