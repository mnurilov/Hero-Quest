THINGS TO DO NEXT TIME:
-I want modulary or whatever its called
-I don't think player should change anything in enemy I think the player should calculate its dmage
and whatever class that operation is being called from can determine what to do with that data
-I don't think the classes should affect each other to allow for modifiability
-DEBUG MODE where a variable is set on and when it is you can see all the output

Ideas
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
-I dont think this would be that hard to implement however its my decision whether id want to
or not 
-If you survive with item item goes up a tier dead by daylight
