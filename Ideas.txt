THINGS TO DO NEXT TIME:
-DEBUG MODE where a variable is set on and when it is you can see all the output

Ideas
-Game Creator App where I make a simple app that allows the user to create the world for the game
and then the app converts it into xml files/this will need to be done after the game is complete
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
-If you survive with item, item goes up a tier dead by daylight

Items
-HP heals
-MP heals
-Silence curer
-Darkness curer
-Slime curer
-Stat boosting items?
