Ideas
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
-I dont think this would be that hard to implement however its my decision whether id want to
or not 
-If you survive with item item goes up a tier dead by daylight

Items
-HP heals
-MP heals
-Silence curer
-Darkness curer
-Slime curer
-Stat boosting items?

Weapons
Sword and Shield - Warrior
Mage and Tome - Mage
Dagger and Dagger - Thief

Quests
-Kill Quest
-Gather Quest
-Travel Quest
-Interact Quest

THINGS TO DO NEXT TIME:
-MAKE VENDORS WORK
-MAKE THE INPUT MANAGER JUST CORRECT THE INPUT AND RETURN IT TO THE STATE
-THE STATE WILL DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THE INPUT
