-Enemys not using mana 
-Player not using mana
-Greed and Empower don't affect everything yet like items and damage taken 

Keep lists null

Greed system if used damage reduced but you get all loot
Bosses

I EXCLUDED 4 CLASSES FROM THE CLASSES MAKE SURE TO TRULY REMOVE THOSE CLASSES WHEN YOU ARE READY

Make lines between map pictures

Different exp rates for different classes

When they cast a spell flash a picture for a second so it looks like an animation

sound effects

music

Ideas
-Game Creator App where I make a simple app that allows the user to create the world for the game
and then the app converts it into xml files/this will need to be done after the game is complete
-Maybe add a chest and a key?
-Maybe a paper mario like leveling system and combat system
-Where when you level up you put your stat points into the attritubtes you want
Allowing the player to craft their own character
-If you survive with item, item goes up a tier dead by daylight

Items
-HP heals
-MP heals
-Silence curer
-Darkness curer
-Slime curer
-Stat boosting items?
